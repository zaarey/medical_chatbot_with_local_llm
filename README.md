# 📌 Medical Chatbot with LangChain and Local LLM

> A medical chatbot that retrieves verified answers from a medical textbook using LangChain, FAISS, and a local Mistral model.

## 📖 Description

This project involves creating a medical chatbot that answers healthcare-related queries by retrieving content from a locally stored, pre-processed medical book.  

- **Why did you build it?** To offer an authentic, book-verified source for medical answers without relying on online APIs or paid LLM services.  
- **What problem does it solve?** Prevents misinformation by restricting answers to a credible, offline medical textbook, while providing transparent source references.  
- **Who is it for?** Medical students, healthcare professionals, and researchers looking for a trusted, offline, book-based Q&A tool.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Retrieves answers strictly from a local medical book database  
- ✅ Displays accurate source metadata (page numbers and sections) with every response  
- ✅ Fast, offline responses with cached FAISS database  
- ✅ Uses a local Mistral model for LLM inference  
- ✅ Simple, clean Streamlit-based user interface  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language(s):** Python  
- **Framework(s):** LangChain, Streamlit  
- **Tools/Libraries:** FAISS, Sentence Transformers, Mistral LLM
